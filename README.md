In#Tune Social network is a Capstone project that counts towards [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/) graduation.
It aims to have several functions listed below in order to practice what I learned.

## Specifications

The Project Requirements are Listed Below

1. The user logs in to the app, only by typing the username (a proper authenticated login is **not** a requirement).

2. The user is presented with the homepage (see the *Homepage* screenshot above) that includes:
    1. Left-side menu (includes only links to pages that are implemented).
    2. *Tweets* tab in the centre (skip *Photos* and *Videos* for this MVP).
